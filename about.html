		<h1>Our History</h1></a>
		<img class="img-responsive" src="image/history.jpg" style="float:right;"/>
		<p>As the flagship hospital for its parent institution, the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), Strong Memorial Hospital’s origins are closely aligned with those of URMC. In 1910, Abraham  Flexner, under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, published a report  on medical schools that led to a major transformation in how medicine was taught across  the country. URMC and Strong Memorial  Hospital were developed from the concept of  establishing a medical school at a university that would utilize Flexner’s revolutionary ideals  in medical education</p>
		<p>The medical school opened its doors in 1925, and less than a year later, Strong Memorial Hospital followed suit. Strong began as a 250-bed community teaching hospital. Since its beginnings over 85 years ago, Strong has expanded to include a wide array of facilities allowing for the delivery of a broad spectrum of high-quality, advanced medical care in a compassionate patient and family-focused environment. Strong has integrated the Golisano Children’s Hospital into its site while additional new and expanded facilities include Ambulatory Care, the Emergency Department, and the URMC Ambulatory Surgery Center, among many others.</p>		
		<p>Today, Strong is an award-winning hospital accommodating approximately 800 acute inpatients and over 39,000 annual admissions. Strong serves patients’ needs as both a community hospital delivering traditional and established medical care services along with highly specialized and advanced medical treatments. True to its heritage, Strong continues to strive for innovative, transformational care that defines Medicine of the Highest Order.</p>

		<h1>Our Commitment to Quality, Safety, and Service—And Your Right to Know </h2>
		</div>
		
		<p>As a Medical Center, no work is more important to us than earning the trust of our patients, their families, and the providers who refer them to us. That’s why our number one priority remains providing a safe, high-quality, patient- and family-centered care experience that combines the best scientific evidence, expert clinical judgment, and truly compassionate care</p>
		<p>Because of this, we’re devoted to continual improvement. And, while we’re understandably enthused by several areas in which we’ve recently shown remarkable progress, we won’t be content until our patient experience is among the best in the country. In fact, our leaders and our URMC Board of Directors challenge us to constantly review our performance and see ourselves as we truly are. This is the key to understanding what we are doing well – and where we still need to do better.</p>
		<p>To benchmark our progress, we collaborate with several organizations – the Joint Commission (JC), the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services, the New York State Department of Health, and others—to monitor and report on key clinical performance initiatives, medical outcomes, and patient satisfaction scores. In the interest of transparency and accountability, this website is our way of sharing a clear and honest report with you. We hope it helps you make informed decisions about your health care.To obtain nursing staffing indicators and nurse-sensitive patient outcome indicators specified in Title 10 Section 400.25 please email SMHQualityDataRequest@URMC.Rochester.edu with the request. The information will be supplied to the requestor within 30 days of submission.</p>
